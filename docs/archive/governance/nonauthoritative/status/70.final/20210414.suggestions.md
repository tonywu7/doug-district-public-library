# Proposal

I have a suggestion:

To reduce clutter, for `#discord-suggestions`, `#emote-suggestions`, and potentially `#stream-suggestions`: create channels that are just for the suggestions themselves.

People can submit their suggestions using a command (easy to use) in a dedicated bot channel, the bot will forward suggestions as embeds to the suggestion channel, then we can use the existing ones just for the discussion of the ideas.

Additionally, people can vote on the suggestions. Voting does nothing special, but is only a form of polling.

# Design

### Channels

**Rename channels** `#stream-suggestions` => `#stream-suggestions-discussion`, `#discord-suggestions` => `#discord-suggestions-discussion`, `#emote-suggestions` => `#emote-suggestions-discussion`.

Alternatively, select one of the three for `#suggestion-discussion` and archive the other two.

**Create channels** `#stream-suggestions`, `#discord-suggestions`, `#emote-suggestions`.

**Permissions** Message disallowed except for bots and mods; new reactions disallowed except for bots and mods (people can still use existing reactions added by Frank); rate-limiting TBD.

**Create channel** `#bot-commands` for sending suggestions.

**Permissions** Standard permissions for Dannylings; suggestion commands will only be enabled with in this channel;

### Commands

**New Frank commands** `?___-suggestion` for each of the three new channels. Example:

```
?stream-suggestion Doug plays Skyrim _normally_
```

Frank will forward all the text after the command as an embed into the respective channels (no quotation mark necessary).
Name of the person calling the command will appear in the embed title.
People are allowed attach images for their suggestions, which will show up in the embed.
For `#emote-suggestions`, an uploaded image is mandatory (linked image disallowed).

Frank will react to the embed with emotes representing approval/disapproval.
People may add to the two reactions (but may not add other emotes, to keep it clean).
Current candidates are :dougHappy: and :dougDoubt:.
People may only vote once for each suggestion, if they vote a second time, their previous vote will be superseded.

**New Frank command** `?suggestion-help`

Frank will DM the user on how to make a suggestion.

**New Frank command** `^https://discord\.com/channels/\d+/(\d+)/(\d+)$`

Within the discussion channels, people may paste a link to a suggestion message in the corresponding suggestion channel,
and Frank will copy the suggestion into the discussion (a way of quoting).

### Transition

To help Doug transition to the new `#stream-suggestions` channel, a command will be setup to convert some of the most recent stream suggestions to the new channel.

### Public

**Welcome to the brand new Doug District Suggestion System:tm: _v0.9_ :sparkles: **

This channel serves two functions:

1. To make suggestions on Doug's Twitch streams, stream music, Discord affairs, as well as new emotes;
2. To discuss proposed suggestions.

To make a suggestion, use the `?suggest` command __**in this channel #suggestions-discussions**__:
`?suggest stream` for #stream-suggestions
`?suggest music` for #stream-music-suggestions
`?suggest discord` for #discord-suggestions
`?suggest emote` for #emote-suggestions
**Your suggestion will be forwarded to the respective channels.** Those channels are now read-only.

You may now **vote** on suggestions in those channels using :arrow_up_small: and :arrow_down_small:. _Voting doesn't guarantee approval or disapproval, but is only a way for you to express your opinion on a suggestion._ (Additional :white_check_mark: and :no_entry_sign: reserved for moderator use)

You may **quote** someone's suggestion by copying the message link to their suggestion in the other channels and paste it here.

To check the usage of the `?suggest` command, send `?suggest` without any additional text.

Please direct all bug reports to @tonyzbf#6586.

Enjoy! :dougConfidence:
