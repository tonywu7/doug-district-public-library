### What would you need? Are any costs attached?

The only operational requirement for the bot is a dedicated server that can commit to 24/7 uptime. With current levels of traffic in this server, and the kind of functions I would like the bot to perform, computing performance is not a major demand. The server does not need to be publicly accessible (it just need to run), although it will need to be for tasks like webhooks. There are a few options:

- My personal AWS EC2 instance. It’s currently idle so there are no extra cost.
- Heroku. Free-tier accounts exists that allow up to 1000 hours of computing per month.
- `dougdougw.com`. I don’t know how the server is set up but I assume we have access to the actual hosting server and not just the web publishing component.

### What potential issues would it have?

- _Service availability._ Although if we choose AWS or Heroku I wouldn’t expect downtime at all in terms of internet access.
- _Development errors._ Perennial and unavoidable. But errors exist with YAGPDB as well, and if I choose Python as the language (with `discord.py`) then it also comes with more ways to handle errors (whereas error handling just doesn’t exist on YAGPDB, because it’s using a _templating_ language).
- _Datenschutz._ (You know the deal.) The custom bot inevitably needs to store information about the server for it to be truly useful in comparison to other general purpose bots, and I’ll need to be responsible over what data to collect.
- _Upkeeping/lack of graphical interfaces._ Because it’s written from scratch, making a web-based control panel for the bot won’t be the initial priority. This means while it would be easy for me to manage the bot, it would be difficult for the rest of the mod team to do so.
- _Naming the bot._ Literally the hardest problem.

### What can be covered under the bot?

A custom bot has advantages over any other bots in the server by virtue of it being _custom-made._ I am not trying to make yet another _Yet Another General Purpose Discord Bot._ In other words, this bot is not meant to replace existing bots that are used for moderation and security, but rather provide functions that are so specific to this server that we will have significant challenges implementing them through other bots.

Specifically, I see the following advantages:

- _Data persistence._ YAGPDB, for all the things it’s able to accomplish, is stateless: it doesn’t remember stuff and is fully unaware of context. It doesn’t know who spammed for how much, or who just called what command at how long ago. Existing DB API it provides is clumsy and limited. With a custom bot, I get to use any form of persistence to keep any data that may be useful.
- _Utilizing Discord’s latest APIs._ It’s already apparent that YAGPDB doesn’t support well some of Discord’s features, such as message attachments and message replies, even though Discord already provides APIs for them. With a custom bot I don’t need to wait for the upstream provider.
- _General programming availability._ YAGPDB uses a template language; there are no `continue`, `break`, or `return`, and it’s therefore incredibly difficult to work with for complex logic. Take the `?time` command for example: the custom command is nearly 9500 characters long, whereas in Python I can just do this and call it a day:

```py
from datetime import datetime
from pytz import timezone, utc

datetime.now(tz=utc).astimezone(timezone('US/Pacific')).strftime('%d %b %Y %I:%M %p')
```

- _**Knowledge about the Doug District.**_ This is I think by far the most compelling reason for a custom bot. There are quite a few constructs in this server that are very unique to this community: timezone designations, specialty and meaningful roles such as the color roles, “Spoonies,” “Gaming Gods,” etc., functional roles (limiting privileges), Game Event system, and now the suggestion system. Having a custom bot means that not only can we create individual, piecemeal commands, we can have entire workflows (maybe scheduled, maybe automated) built that are just for those purposes.

Base on these, there are a few features I think will be great for the custom bot:

- _Improving the suggestion system._ YAGPDB lacks in attachment handling and associating multiple messages. While not urgent (I mean none of these functions are urgent ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯), better support for these Discord components allow for more complex suggestions. Also support for attachments will vastly improve #emote-suggestions.
- _Integrating with other platforms:_ Doug’s YouTube channels, reddit, Twitch, etc. Existing webhooks are slow because we are sharing a third-party free service with millions of other users and we don’t get prioritized. If we get a custom bot we can poll the channels however frequently we want, and we get to customize filters and how notifications are written/delivered.
- _Doug District Museum._ This was from a while ago. In this server we utilize pinned messages to showcase the incredible Literature™️ server members produce everyday. But it is lossy due to limits of the pinning function. It will be interesting to have a semi-automated system for centralizing and preserving such precious Literature™️. Doing so requires the ability to read/manage pinned messages and functions such as attributing messages, which no mainstream bots currently provide (and even if there are, this is such a themed feature that we would want better customization to suit the atmosphere of the server).
- _DougDoug Knowledge Base._ Providing information about Doug, from streaming scheduling to stream playlists to music querying to lores and trivia. While this can be done with YAGPDB and custom commands, it would be significantly easier to update information if it were done with a custom bot. Furthermore, at some point in the future, I want to make it a natural language based _chatbot,_ so that instead of having to rigidly type in a command, the bot may answer a question whenever new members ask a question naturally. It does not seem like publicly hosted bots will provide this level of functionality because of how computationally-expensive this would be (and it’s also not safe).

These are some of the ideas I currently have, but the point is that the bot is not going to cover whatever is already well-covered by other bots: moderation tools, identification, music playing, etc. Instead, the functions will be closely related to Doug and the community.

### How likely is it going to fail in compared to currently existing bots? Are there alternatives to the custom bot that are better?

As stated above, because I intend the bot to cater to entirely different, specialized features, it is not going to be comparable to general purpose bots such as YAGPDB. It will be more “likely” to fail by virtue of it carrying out much more integrated functions (having more components) instead of simple commands. At the same time, there are design choices (modularization, unit tests) that can be made to minimize the chance of the entire bot failing, even if specific functions may encounter errors. Of course, I expect abuse (spam) handling and malformed input to be the most challenging part, and I still need to learn more about Discord’s API to understand the system.

### How much maintenance is required for the bot?

Minimal. The bot is supposed to run unsupervised. This means two things: it should not require frequent restarting/resetting (it should run 24/7), and when an error arises, it should notify me about it, so that it should not require constant monitoring. With features like the suggestion system being mostly centered upon new messages (no long-running background tasks), most of the time the bot will simply be idle anyway.

### How long would you need for the implementation?

I am busy with finals so I have limited availability. The bot is not urgent, as YAGPDB runs mostly fine for now. But I have started experimenting with the APIs and I may be able to have a replica for the suggestion system in a week or two.
