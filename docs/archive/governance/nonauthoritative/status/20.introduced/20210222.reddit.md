## Proposal:

- Create a `#reddit` channel, which would feature contents posted by subscribers of the r/DougDoug reddit; the channel is automated by a bot. _(tony)_
- Optionally, create a new role for users who would like to see updates from such a channel, such that the channel is normally hidden to users without such role. _(Pickrog)_

## Opinions

- **Argument for:** A `#reddit` channel helps promote creative work from the community and awards them better recognition, especially within Discord; this in turn promotes the r/DougDoug subreddit, encouraging more people to check it out. _(tony)_
    - **Dissent:** Current contents on r/DougDoug are not of enough quality to deserve its own channel. _(Dr.radical)_
        - **Dissent:** That most posts being of low quality should not prevent good contents from receiving better recognition outside of Reddit. _(tony)_
- **Argument against:** This server has enough channels; creating an additional channel is doing the reverse of the server revamp from September 2020. _(Dr.radical, Pickrog)_
    - **Dissent:** The Doug District has grown a lot since September 2020, and structural changes like a `#reddit` channel should be welcomed, even though it may not have a great impact. _(luna)_
    - **Dissent:** An automated channel like this requires minimal effort in setup and moderation. _(tony)_
- **Argument against (hypothetical):** Current capacity of social media automation for The Doug District (which uses Zapier for actions) may not support an additional integration. _(umbu)_
    - **Comment:** This is a dealbreaker that should completely prevent this proposal from moving further. _(tony)_
- **Comment:** A `#reddit` channel shall not be implemented before stricter moderation are enforced upstream. Better moderation tools may be required on r/DougDoug. _(umbu; tony, Dr.radical, luna)_
